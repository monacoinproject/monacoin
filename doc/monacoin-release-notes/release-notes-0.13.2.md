Monacoin Core version 0.13.2 is now available from:

  <https://download.monacoin.org/monacoin-0.13.2.1/>

This is a new major version release, including new features, various bugfixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.
It is recommended to upgrade to this version.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/monacoinproject/monacoin/issues>

Compatibility
==============

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
an OS initially released in 2001. This means that not even critical security
updates will be released anymore. Without security updates, using a monacoin
wallet on a XP machine is irresponsible at least.

In addition to that, with 0.12.x there have been varied reports of Bitcoin Core
randomly crashing on Windows XP. It is [not clear](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/7681#issuecomment-217439891)
what the source of these crashes is, but it is likely that upstream
libraries such as Qt are no longer being tested on XP.

We do not have time nor resources to provide support for an OS that is
end-of-life. From 0.13.0 on, Windows XP is no longer supported. Users are
suggested to upgrade to a newer version of Windows, or install an alternative OS
that is supported.

No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP,
you can still do so at your own risk, but do not expect it to work: do not
report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

From 0.13.1 onwards OS X 10.7 is no longer supported. 0.13.0 was intended to work on 10.7+,
but severe issues with the libc++ version on 10.7.x keep it from running reliably.
0.13.1 now requires 10.8+, and will communicate that to 10.7 users, rather than crashing unexpectedly.

Notable changes
===============

Signature validation using libsecp256k1
---------------------------------------

ECDSA signatures inside Monacoin transactions now use validation using
[libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) instead of OpenSSL.

Depending on the platform, this means a significant speedup for raw signature
validation speed. The advantage is largest on x86_64, where validation is over
five times faster. In practice, this translates to a raw reindexing and new
block validation times that are less than half of what it was before.

Libsecp256k1 has undergone very extensive testing and validation.

A side effect of this change is that libconsensus no longer depends on OpenSSL.

Reduce upload traffic
---------------------

A major part of the outbound traffic is caused by serving historic blocks to
other nodes in initial block download state.

It is now possible to reduce the total upload traffic via the `-maxuploadtarget`
parameter. This is *not* a hard limit but a threshold to minimize the outbound
traffic. When the limit is about to be reached, the uploaded data is cut by not
serving historic blocks (blocks older than one week).
Moreover, any SPV peer is disconnected when they request a filtered block.

This option can be specified in MiB per day and is turned off by default
(`-maxuploadtarget=0`).
The recommended minimum is 144 * MAX_BLOCK_SIZE (currently 144MB) per day.

Whitelisted peers will never be disconnected, although their traffic counts for
calculating the target.

A more detailed documentation about keeping traffic low can be found in
[/doc/reduce-traffic.md](/doc/reduce-traffic.md).

Direct headers announcement (BIP 130)
-------------------------------------

Between compatible peers, [BIP 130]
(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0130.mediawiki)
direct headers announcement is used. This means that blocks are advertised by
announcing their headers directly, instead of just announcing the hash. In a
reorganization, all new headers are sent, instead of just the new tip. This
can often prevent an extra roundtrip before the actual block is downloaded.

Memory pool limiting
--------------------

Previous versions of Monacoin Core had their mempool limited by checking
a transaction's fees against the node's minimum relay fee. There was no
upper bound on the size of the mempool and attackers could send a large
number of transactions paying just slighly more than the default minimum
relay fee to crash nodes with relatively low RAM. A temporary workaround
for previous versions of Monacoin Core was to raise the default minimum
relay fee.

Monacoin Core 0.13.2 will have a strict maximum size on the mempool. The
default value is 300 MB and can be configured with the `-maxmempool`
parameter. Whenever a transaction would cause the mempool to exceed
its maximum size, the transaction that (along with in-mempool descendants) has
the lowest total feerate (as a package) will be evicted and the node's effective
minimum relay feerate will be increased to match this feerate plus the initial
minimum relay feerate. The initial minimum relay feerate is set to
1000 satoshis per kB.

Monacoin Core 0.13.2 also introduces new default policy limits on the length and
size of unconfirmed transaction chains that are allowed in the mempool
(generally limiting the length of unconfirmed chains to 25 transactions, with a
total size of 101 KB).  These limits can be overriden using command line
arguments; see the extended help (`--help -help-debug`) for more information.

RPC: Random-cookie RPC authentication
-------------------------------------

When no `-rpcpassword` is specified, the daemon now uses a special 'cookie'
file for authentication. This file is generated with random content when the
daemon starts, and deleted when it exits. Its contents are used as
authentication token. Read access to this file controls who can access through
RPC. By default it is stored in the data directory but its location can be
overridden with the option `-rpccookiefile`.

This is similar to Tor's CookieAuthentication: see
https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en

This allows running monacoind without having to do any manual configuration.

Relay: Any sequence of pushdatas in OP_RETURN outputs now allowed
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Previously OP_RETURN outputs with a payload were only relayed and mined if they
had a single pushdata. This restriction has been lifted to allow any
combination of data pushes and numeric constant opcodes (OP_1 to OP_16) after
the OP_RETURN. The limit on OP_RETURN output size is now applied to the entire
serialized scriptPubKey, 83 bytes by default. (the previous 80 byte default plus
three bytes overhead)

Relay: New and only new blocks relayed when pruning
---------------------------------------------------

When running in pruned mode, the client will now relay new blocks. When
responding to the `getblocks` message, only hashes of blocks that are on disk
and are likely to remain there for some reasonable time window (1 hour) will be
returned (previously all relevant hashes were returned).

Relay and Mining: Priority transactions
---------------------------------------

Monacoin Core has a heuristic 'priority' based on coin value and age. This
calculation is used for relaying of transactions which do not pay the
minimum relay fee, and can be used as an alternative way of sorting
transactions for mined blocks. Monacoin Core will relay transactions with
insufficient fees depending on the setting of `-limitfreerelay=<r>` (default:
`r=15` kB per minute) and `-blockprioritysize=<s>`.

In Bitcoin Core 0.12, when mempool limit has been reached a higher minimum
relay fee takes effect to limit memory usage. Transactions which do not meet
this higher effective minimum relay fee will not be relayed or mined even if
they rank highly according to the priority heuristic.

The mining of transactions based on their priority is also now disabled by
default. To re-enable it, simply set `-blockprioritysize=<n>` where is the size
in bytes of your blocks to reserve for these transactions. The old default was
50k, so to retain approximately the same policy, you would set
`-blockprioritysize=50000`.

Additionally, as a result of computational simplifications, the priority value
used for transactions received with unconfirmed inputs is lower than in prior
versions due to avoiding recomputing the amounts as input transactions confirm.

External miner policy set via the `prioritisetransaction` RPC to rank
transactions already in the mempool continues to work as it has previously.
Note, however, that if mining priority transactions is left disabled, the
priority delta will be ignored and only the fee metric will be effective.

This internal automatic prioritization handling is being considered for removal
entirely in Monacoin Core 0.13, and it is at this time undecided whether the
more accurate priority calculation for chained unconfirmed transactions will be
restored. Community direction on this topic is particularly requested to help
set project priorities.

Automatically use Tor hidden services
-------------------------------------

Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socket
API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' hidden services programmatically.
Monacoin Core has been updated to make use of this.

This means that if Tor is running (and proper authorization is available),
Monacoin Core automatically creates a hidden service to listen on, without
manual configuration. Monacoin Core will also use Tor automatically to connect
to other .onion nodes if the control socket can be successfully opened. This
will positively affect the number of available .onion nodes and their usage.

This new feature is enabled by default if Monacoin Core is listening, and
a connection to Tor can be made. It can be configured with the `-listenonion`,
`-torcontrol` and `-torpassword` settings. To show verbose debugging
information, pass `-debug=tor`.

Notifications through ZMQ
-------------------------

Monacoind can now (optionally) asynchronously notify clients through a
ZMQ-based PUB socket of the arrival of new transactions and blocks.
This feature requires installation of the ZMQ C API library 4.x and
configuring its use through the command line or configuration file.
Please see [docs/zmq.md](/doc/zmq.md) for details of operation.

Wallet: Transaction fees
------------------------

Various improvements have been made to how the wallet calculates
transaction fees.

Users can decide to pay a predefined fee rate by setting `-paytxfee=<n>`
(or `settxfee <n>` rpc during runtime). A value of `n=0` signals Monacoin
Core to use floating fees. By default, Monacoin Core will use floating
fees.

Based on past transaction data, floating fees approximate the fees
required to get into the `m`th block from now. This is configurable
with `-txconfirmtarget=<m>` (default: `2`).

Sometimes, it is not possible to give good estimates, or an estimate
at all. Therefore, a fallback value can be set with `-fallbackfee=<f>`
(default: `0.0002` MONA/kB).

At all times, Monacoin Core will cap fees at `-maxtxfee=<x>` (default:
0.10) MONA.
Furthermore, Monacoin Core will never create transactions paying less than
the current minimum relay fee.
Finally, a user can set the minimum fee rate for all transactions with
`-mintxfee=<i>`, which defaults to 1000 satoshis per kB.

Wallet: Negative confirmations and conflict detection
-----------------------------------------------------

The wallet will now report a negative number for confirmations that indicates
how deep in the block chain the conflict is found. For example, if a transaction
A has 5 confirmations and spends the same input as a wallet transaction B, B
will be reported as having -5 confirmations. If another wallet transaction C
spends an output from B, it will also be reported as having -5 confirmations.
To detect conflicts with historical transactions in the chain a one-time
`-rescan` may be needed.

Unlike earlier versions, unconfirmed but non-conflicting transactions will never
get a negative confirmation count. They are not treated as spendable unless
they're coming from ourself (change) and accepted into our local mempool,
however. The new "trusted" field in the `listtransactions` RPC output
indicates whether outputs of an unconfirmed transaction are considered
spendable.

Wallet: Merkle branches removed
-------------------------------

Previously, every wallet transaction stored a Merkle branch to prove its
presence in blocks. This wasn't being used for more than an expensive
sanity check. Since 0.13.2, these are no longer stored. When loading a
0.13.2 wallet into an older version, it will automatically rescan to avoid
failed checks.

Wallet: Pruning
---------------

With 0.13.2 it is possible to use wallet functionality in pruned mode.
This can reduce the disk usage from currently around 6 GB to
around 0.2 GB.

However, rescans as well as the RPCs `importwallet`, `importaddress`,
`importprivkey` are disabled.

To enable block pruning set `prune=<N>` on the command line or in
`monacoin.conf`, where `N` is the number of MiB to allot for
raw block & undo data.

A value of 0 disables pruning. The minimal value above 0 is 550. Your
wallet is as secure with high values as it is with low ones. Higher
values merely ensure that your node will not shut down upon blockchain
reorganizations of more than 2 days - which are unlikely to happen in
practice. In future releases, a higher value may also help the network
as a whole: stored blocks could be served to other nodes.

For further information about pruning, you may also consult the [release
notes of Bitcoin Core v0.11.0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.11.0/doc/release-notes.md#block-file-pruning).

`NODE_BLOOM` service bit
------------------------

Support for the `NODE_BLOOM` service bit, as described in [BIP
111](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0111.mediawiki), has been
added to the P2P protocol code.

BIP 111 defines a service bit to allow peers to advertise that they support
bloom filters (such as used by SPV clients) explicitly. It also bumps the protocol
version to allow peers to identify old nodes which allow bloom filtering of the
connection despite lacking the new service bit.

In this version, it is only enforced for peers that send protocol versions
`>=70011`. For the next major version it is planned that this restriction will be
removed. It is recommended to update SPV clients to check for the `NODE_BLOOM`
service bit for nodes that report versions newer than 70011.

Option parsing behavior
-----------------------

Command line options are now parsed strictly in the order in which they are
specified. It used to be the case that `-X -noX` ends up, unintuitively, with X
set, as `-X` had precedence over `-noX`. This is no longer the case. Like for
other software, the last specified value for an option will hold.

RPC: Low-level API changes
--------------------------

- Monetary amounts can be provided as strings. This means that for example the
  argument to sendtoaddress can be "0.0001" instead of 0.0001. This can be an
  advantage if a JSON library insists on using a lossy floating point type for
  numbers, which would be dangerous for monetary amounts.

* The `asm` property of each scriptSig now contains the decoded signature hash
  type for each signature that provides a valid defined hash type.

* OP_NOP2 has been renamed to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY by [BIP 65](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki)

The following items contain assembly representations of scriptSig signatures
and are affected by this change:

- RPC `getrawtransaction`
- RPC `decoderawtransaction`
- RPC `decodescript`
- REST `/rest/tx/` (JSON format)
- REST `/rest/block/` (JSON format when including extended tx details)
- `monacoin-tx -json`

For example, the `scriptSig.asm` property of a transaction input that
previously showed an assembly representation of:

    304502207fa7a6d1e0ee81132a269ad84e68d695483745cde8b541e3bf630749894e342a022100c1f7ab20e13e22fb95281a870f3dcf38d782e53023ee313d741ad0cfbc0c509001 400000 OP_NOP2

now shows as:

    304502207fa7a6d1e0ee81132a269ad84e68d695483745cde8b541e3bf630749894e342a022100c1f7ab20e13e22fb95281a870f3dcf38d782e53023ee313d741ad0cfbc0c5090[ALL] 400000 OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY

Note that the output of the RPC `decodescript` did not change because it is
configured specifically to process scriptPubKey and not scriptSig scripts.

RPC: SSL support dropped
------------------------

SSL support for RPC, previously enabled by the option `rpcssl` has been dropped
from both the client and the server. This was done in preparation for removing
the dependency on OpenSSL for the daemon completely.

Trying to use `rpcssl` will result in an error:

    Error: SSL mode for RPC (-rpcssl) is no longer supported.

If you are one of the few people that relies on this feature, a flexible
migration path is to use `stunnel`. This is an utility that can tunnel
arbitrary TCP connections inside SSL. On e.g. Ubuntu it can be installed with:

    sudo apt-get install stunnel4

Then, to tunnel a SSL connection on 29332 to a RPC server bound on localhost on port 19334 do:

    stunnel -d 29332 -r 127.0.0.1:19334 -p stunnel.pem -P ''

It can also be set up system-wide in inetd style.

Another way to re-attain SSL would be to setup a httpd reverse proxy. This solution
would allow the use of different authentication, loadbalancing, on-the-fly compression and
caching. A sample config for apache2 could look like:

    Listen 443

    NameVirtualHost *:443
    <VirtualHost *:443>

    SSLEngine On
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.key

    <Location /monacoinrpc>
        ProxyPass http://127.0.0.1:9332/
        ProxyPassReverse http://127.0.0.1:9332/
        # optional enable digest auth
        # AuthType Digest
        # ...

        # optional bypass monacoind rpc basic auth
        # RequestHeader set Authorization "Basic <hash>"
        # get the <hash> from the shell with: base64 <<< monacoinrpc:<password>
    </Location>

    # Or, balance the load:
    # ProxyPass / balancer://balancer_cluster_name

    </VirtualHost>

Other P2P Changes
-----------------

The list of banned peers is now stored on disk rather than in memory.
Restarting monacoind will no longer clear out the list of banned peers; instead
a new RPC call (`clearbanned`) can be used to manually clear the list.  The new
`setban` RPC call can also be used to manually ban or unban a peer.

Database cache memory increased
--------------------------------

As a result of growth of the UTXO set, performance with the prior default
database cache of 100 MiB has suffered.
For this reason the default was changed to 300 MiB in this release.

For nodes on low-memory systems, the database cache can be changed back to
100 MiB (or to another value) by either:

- Adding `dbcache=100` in monacoin.conf
- Changing it in the GUI under `Options → Size of database cache`

Note that the database cache setting has the most performance impact
during initial sync of a node, and when catching up after downtime.


monacoin-cli: arguments privacy
------------------------------

The RPC command line client gained a new argument, `-stdin`
to read extra arguments from standard input, one per line until EOF/Ctrl-D.
For example:

    $ src/monacoin-cli -stdin walletpassphrase
    mysecretcode
    120
    ..... press Ctrl-D here to end input
    $

It is recommended to use this for sensitive information such as wallet
passphrases, as command-line arguments can usually be read from the process
table by any user on the system.


C++11 and Python 3
------------------

Various code modernizations have been done. The Monacoin Core code base has
started using C++11. This means that a C++11-capable compiler is now needed for
building. Effectively this means GCC 4.7 or higher, or Clang 3.3 or higher.

When cross-compiling for a target that doesn't have C++11 libraries, configure with
`./configure --enable-glibc-back-compat ... LDFLAGS=-static-libstdc++`.

For running the functional tests in `qa/rpc-tests`, Python3.4 or higher is now
required.


Linux ARM builds
----------------

Due to popular request, Linux ARM builds have been added to the uploaded
executables.

The following extra files can be found in the download directory or torrent:

- `monacoin-${VERSION}-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz`: Linux binaries for the most
  common 32-bit ARM architecture.
- `monacoin-${VERSION}-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz`: Linux binaries for the most
  common 64-bit ARM architecture.

ARM builds are still experimental. If you have problems on a certain device or
Linux distribution combination please report them on the bug tracker, it may be
possible to resolve them.

Note that Android is not considered ARM Linux in this context. The executables
are not expected to work out of the box on Android.

BIP68 soft fork to enforce sequence locks for relative locktime
---------------------------------------------------------------

[BIP68][] introduces relative lock-time consensus-enforced semantics of
the sequence number field to enable a signed transaction input to remain
invalid for a defined period of time after confirmation of its corresponding
outpoint.

For more information about the implementation, see
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7184>

BIP112 soft fork to enforce OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
--------------------------------------------------

[BIP112][] redefines the existing OP_NOP3 as OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV)
for a new opcode in the Monacoin scripting system that in combination with
[BIP68][] allows execution pathways of a script to be restricted based
on the age of the output being spent.

For more information about the implementation, see
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7524>

BIP113 locktime enforcement soft fork
-------------------------------------

This release seeks to make mempool-only locktime enforcement using GetMedianTimePast() 
a consensus rule.

Monacoin transactions currently may specify a locktime indicating when
they may be added to a valid block.  Current consensus rules require
that blocks have a block header time greater than the locktime specified
in any transaction in that block.

Miners get to choose what time they use for their header time, with the
consensus rule being that no node will accept a block whose time is more
than two hours in the future.  This creates a incentive for miners to
set their header times to future values in order to include locktimed
transactions which weren't supposed to be included for up to two more
hours.

The consensus rules also specify that valid blocks may have a header
time greater than that of the median of the 11 previous blocks.  This
GetMedianTimePast() time has a key feature we generally associate with
time: it can't go backwards.

[BIP113][] specifies a soft fork enforced in this release that
weakens this perverse incentive for individual miners to use a future
time by requiring that valid blocks have a computed GetMedianTimePast()
greater than the locktime specified in any transaction in that block.

Mempool inclusion rules currently require transactions to be valid for
immediate inclusion in a block in order to be accepted into the mempool.
This release begins applying the BIP113 rule to received transactions,
so transaction whose time is greater than the GetMedianTimePast() will
no longer be accepted into the mempool.

**Implication for miners:** you will begin rejecting transactions that
would not be valid under BIP113, which will prevent you from producing
invalid blocks when BIP113 is enforced on the network. Any
transactions which are valid under the current rules but not yet valid
under the BIP113 rules will either be mined by other miners or delayed
until they are valid under BIP113. Note, however, that time-based
locktime transactions are more or less unseen on the network currently.

**Implication for users:** GetMedianTimePast() always trails behind the
current time, so a transaction locktime set to the present time will be
rejected by nodes running this release until the median time moves
forward. To compensate, subtract one hour (3,600 seconds) from your
locktimes to allow those transactions to be included in mempools at
approximately the expected time.

For more information about the implementation, see
<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6566>


Compact Block support (BIP 152)
-------------------------------

Support for block relay using the Compact Blocks protocol has been implemented
in PR 8068.

The primary goal is reducing the bandwidth spikes at relay time, though in many
cases it also reduces propagation delay. It is automatically enabled between
compatible peers.
[BIP 152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki)

As a side-effect, ordinary non-mining nodes will download and upload blocks
faster if those blocks were produced by miners using similar transaction
filtering policies. This means that a miner who produces a block with many
transactions discouraged by your node will be relayed slower than one with
only transactions already in your memory pool. The overall effect of such
relay differences on the network may result in blocks which include widely-
discouraged transactions losing a stale block race, and therefore miners may
wish to configure their node to take common relay policies into consideration.


Hierarchical Deterministic Key Generation
-----------------------------------------
Newly created wallets will use hierarchical deterministic key generation
according to BIP32 (keypath m/0'/0'/k').
Existing wallets will still use traditional key generation.

Backups of HD wallets, regardless of when they have been created, can
therefore be used to re-generate all possible private keys, even the
ones which haven't already been generated during the time of the backup.
**Attention:** Encrypting the wallet will create a new seed which requires
a new backup!

Wallet dumps (created using the `dumpwallet` RPC) will contain the deterministic
seed. This is expected to allow future versions to import the seed and all
associated funds, but this is not yet implemented.

HD key generation for new wallets can be disabled by `-usehd=0`. Keep in
mind that this flag only has affect on newly created wallets.
You can't disable HD key generation once you have created a HD wallet.

There is no distinction between internal (change) and external keys.

HD wallets are incompatible with older versions of Monacoin Core.

[Pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8035/files), [BIP 32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)


Mining transaction selection ("Child Pays For Parent")
------------------------------------------------------

The mining transaction selection algorithm has been replaced with an algorithm
that selects transactions based on their feerate inclusive of unconfirmed
ancestor transactions.  This means that a low-fee transaction can become more
likely to be selected if a high-fee transaction that spends its outputs is
relayed.

With this change, the `-blockminsize` command line option has been removed.

The command line option `-blockmaxsize` remains an option to specify the
maximum number of serialized bytes in a generated block.  In addition, the new
command line option `-blockmaxweight` has been added, which specifies the
maximum "block weight" of a generated block, as defined by [BIP 141 (Segregated
Witness)] (https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki).

In preparation for Segregated Witness, the mining algorithm has been modified
to optimize transaction selection for a given block weight, rather than a given
number of serialized bytes in a block.  In this release, transaction selection
is unaffected by this distinction (as BIP 141 activation is not supported on
mainnet in this release, see above), but in future releases and after BIP 141
activation, these calculations would be expected to differ.

For optimal runtime performance, miners using this release should specify
`-blockmaxweight` on the command line, and not specify `-blockmaxsize`.
Additionally (or only) specifying `-blockmaxsize`, or relying on default
settings for both, may result in performance degradation, as the logic to
support `-blockmaxsize` performs additional computation to ensure that
constraint is met.  (Note that for mainnet, in this release, the equivalent
parameter for `-blockmaxweight` would be four times the desired
`-blockmaxsize`.  See [BIP 141]
(https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki) for additional
details.)

In the future, the `-blockmaxsize` option may be removed, as block creation is
no longer optimized for this metric.  Feedback is requested on whether to
deprecate or keep this command line option in future releases.


Reindexing changes
------------------

In earlier versions, reindexing did validation while reading through the block
files on disk. These two have now been split up, so that all blocks are known
before validation starts. This was necessary to make certain optimizations that
are available during normal synchronizations also available during reindexing.

The two phases are distinct in the Monacoin-Qt GUI. During the first one,
"Reindexing blocks on disk" is shown. During the second (slower) one,
"Processing blocks on disk" is shown.

It is possible to only redo validation now, without rebuilding the block index,
using the command line option `-reindex-chainstate` (in addition to
`-reindex` which does both). This new option is useful when the blocks on disk
are assumed to be fine, but the chainstate is still corrupted. It is also
useful for benchmarks.


Removal of internal miner
--------------------------

As CPU mining has been useless for a long time, the internal miner has been
removed in this release, and replaced with a simpler implementation for the
test framework.

The overall result of this is that `setgenerate` RPC call has been removed, as
well as the `-gen` and `-genproclimit` command-line options.

For testing, the `generate` call can still be used to mine a block, and a new
RPC call `generatetoaddress` has been added to mine to a specific address. This
works with wallet disabled.


New bytespersigop implementation
--------------------------------

The former implementation of the bytespersigop filter accidentally broke bare
multisig (which is meant to be controlled by the `permitbaremultisig` option),
since the consensus protocol always counts these older transaction forms as 20
sigops for backwards compatibility. Simply fixing this bug by counting more
accurately would have reintroduced a vulnerability. It has therefore been
replaced with a new implementation that rather than filter such transactions,
instead treats them (for fee purposes only) as if they were in fact the size
of a transaction actually using all 20 sigops.


Low-level P2P changes
----------------------

- The optional new p2p message "feefilter" is implemented and the protocol
  version is bumped to 70013. Upon receiving a feefilter message from a peer,
  a node will not send invs for any transactions which do not meet the filter
  feerate. [BIP 133](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0133.mediawiki)

- The P2P alert system has been removed in PR #7692 and the `alert` P2P message
  is no longer supported.

- The transaction relay mechanism used to relay one quarter of all transactions
  instantly, while queueing up the rest and sending them out in batch. As
  this resulted in chains of dependent transactions being reordered, it
  systematically hurt transaction relay. The relay code was redesigned in PRs
  \#7840 and #8082, and now always batches transactions announcements while also
  sorting them according to dependency order. This significantly reduces orphan
  transactions. To compensate for the removal of instant relay, the frequency of
  batch sending was doubled for outgoing peers.

- Since PR #7840 the BIP35 `mempool` command is also subject to batch processing.
  Also the `mempool` message is no longer handled for non-whitelisted peers when
  `NODE_BLOOM` is disabled through `-peerbloomfilters=0`.

- The maximum size of orphan transactions that are kept in memory until their
  ancestors arrive has been raised in PR #8179 from 5000 to 99999 bytes. They
  are now also removed from memory when they are included in a block, conflict
  with a block, and time out after 20 minutes.

- We respond at most once to a getaddr request during the lifetime of a
  connection since PR #7856.

- Connections to peers who have recently been the first one to give us a valid
  new block or transaction are protected from disconnections since PR #8084.


Low-level RPC changes
----------------------

- RPC calls have been added to output detailed statistics for individual mempool
  entries, as well as to calculate the in-mempool ancestors or descendants of a
  transaction: see `getmempoolentry`, `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`.

- `gettxoutsetinfo` UTXO hash (`hash_serialized`) has changed. There was a divergence between
  32-bit and 64-bit platforms, and the txids were missing in the hashed data. This has been
  fixed, but this means that the output will be different than from previous versions.

- Full UTF-8 support in the RPC API. Non-ASCII characters in, for example,
  wallet labels have always been malformed because they weren't taken into account
  properly in JSON RPC processing. This is no longer the case. This also affects
  the GUI debug console.

- Asm script outputs replacements for OP_NOP2 and OP_NOP3

  - OP_NOP2 has been renamed to OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY by [BIP
65](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki)

  - OP_NOP3 has been renamed to OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY by [BIP
112](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki)

  - The following outputs are affected by this change:

    - RPC `getrawtransaction` (in verbose mode)
    - RPC `decoderawtransaction`
    - RPC `decodescript`
    - REST `/rest/tx/` (JSON format)
    - REST `/rest/block/` (JSON format when including extended tx details)
    - `monacoin-tx -json`

- The sorting of the output of the `getrawmempool` output has changed.

- New RPC commands: `generatetoaddress`, `importprunedfunds`, `removeprunedfunds`, `signmessagewithprivkey`,
  `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolentry`,
  `createwitnessaddress`, `addwitnessaddress`.

- Removed RPC commands: `setgenerate`, `getgenerate`.

- New options were added to `fundrawtransaction`: `includeWatching`, `changeAddress`, `changePosition` and `feeRate`.


Low-level ZMQ changes
----------------------

- Each ZMQ notification now contains an up-counting sequence number that allows
  listeners to detect lost notifications.
  The sequence number is always the last element in a multi-part ZMQ notification and
  therefore backward compatible. Each message type has its own counter.

Segregated witness soft fork
----------------------------

Segregated witness (segwit) is a soft fork that, if activated, will
allow transaction-producing software to separate (segregate) transaction
signatures (witnesses) from the part of the data in a transaction that is
covered by the txid. This provides several immediate benefits:

- **Elimination of unwanted transaction malleability:** Segregating the witness
  allows both existing and upgraded software to calculate the transaction
  identifier (txid) of transactions without referencing the witness, which can
  sometimes be changed by third-parties (such as miners) or by co-signers in a
  multisig spend. This solves all known cases of unwanted transaction
  malleability, which is a problem that makes programming Monacoin wallet
  software more difficult and which seriously complicates the design of smart
  contracts for Monacoin.

- **Capacity increase:** Segwit transactions contain new fields that are not
  part of the data currently used to calculate the size of a block, which
  allows a block containing segwit transactions to hold more data than allowed
  by the current maximum block size. Estimates based on the transactions
  currently found in blocks indicate that if all wallets switch to using
  segwit, the network will be able to support about 70% more transactions. The
  network will also be able to support more of the advanced-style payments
  (such as multisig) than it can support now because of the different weighting
  given to different parts of a transaction after segwit activates (see the
  following section for details).

- **Weighting data based on how it affects node performance:** Some parts of
  each Monacoin block need to be stored by nodes in order to validate future
  blocks; other parts of a block can be immediately forgotten (pruned) or used
  only for helping other nodes sync their copy of the block chain.  One large
  part of the immediately prunable data are transaction signatures (witnesses),
  and segwit makes it possible to give a different "weight" to segregated
  witnesses to correspond with the lower demands they place on node resources.
  Specifically, each byte of a segregated witness is given a weight of 1, each
  other byte in a block is given a weight of 4, and the maximum allowed weight
  of a block is 4 million.  Weighting the data this way better aligns the most
  profitable strategy for creating blocks with the long-term costs of block
  validation.

- **Signature covers value:** A simple improvement in the way signatures are
  generated in segwit simplifies the design of secure signature generators
  (such as hardware wallets), reduces the amount of data the signature
  generator needs to download, and allows the signature generator to operate
  more quickly.  This is made possible by having the generator sign the amount
  of monacoins they think they are spending, and by having full nodes refuse to
  accept those signatures unless the amount of monacoins being spent is exactly
  the same as was signed.  For non-segwit transactions, wallets instead had to
  download the complete previous transactions being spent for every payment
  they made, which could be a slow operation on hardware wallets and in other
  situations where bandwidth or computation speed was constrained.

- **Linear scaling of sighash operations:** In 2015 a block was produced that
  required about 25 seconds to validate on modern hardware because of the way
  transaction signature hashes are performed.  Other similar blocks, or blocks
  that could take even longer to validate, can still be produced today.  The
  problem that caused this can't be fixed in a soft fork without unwanted
  side-effects, but transactions that opt-in to using segwit will now use a
  different signature method that doesn't suffer from this problem and doesn't
  have any unwanted side-effects.

- **Increased security for multisig:** Monacoin addresses (both P2PKH addresses
  that start with a '1' and P2SH addresses that start with a '3' or 'M') use a hash
  function known as RIPEMD-160.  For P2PKH addresses, this provides about 160
  bits of security---which is beyond what cryptographers believe can be broken
  today.  But because P2SH is more flexible, only about 80 bits of security is
  provided per address. Although 80 bits is very strong security, it is within
  the realm of possibility that it can be broken by a powerful adversary.
  Segwit allows advanced transactions to use the SHA256 hash function instead,
  which provides about 128 bits of security  (that is 281 trillion times as
  much security as 80 bits and is equivalent to the maximum bits of security
  believed to be provided by Monacoin's choice of parameters for its Elliptic
  Curve Digital Security Algorithm [ECDSA].)

- **More efficient almost-full-node security** Satoshi Nakamoto's original
  Bitcoin paper describes a method for allowing newly-started full nodes to
  skip downloading and validating some data from historic blocks that are
  protected by large amounts of proof of work.  Unfortunately, Nakamoto's
  method can't guarantee that a newly-started node using this method will
  produce an accurate copy of Monacoin's current ledger (called the UTXO set),
  making the node vulnerable to falling out of consensus with other nodes.
  Although the problems with Nakamoto's method can't be fixed in a soft fork,
  Segwit accomplishes something similar to his original proposal: it makes it
  possible for a node to optionally skip downloading some blockchain data
  (specifically, the segregated witnesses) while still ensuring that the node
  can build an accurate copy of the UTXO set for the block chain with the most
  proof of work.  Segwit enables this capability at the consensus layer, but
  note that Monacoin Core does not provide an option to use this capability as
  of this 0.13.2 release.

- **Script versioning:** Segwit makes it easy for future soft forks to allow
  Monacoin users to individually opt-in to almost any change in the Monacoin
  Script language when those users receive new transactions.  Features
  currently being researched by Bitcoin and Monacoin Core contributors that may
  use this capability include support for Schnorr signatures, which can improve
  the privacy and efficiency of multisig transactions (or transactions with
  multiple inputs), and Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), which can
  improve the privacy and efficiency of scripts with two or more conditions.
  Other Bitcoin community members are studying several other improvements
  that can be made using script versioning.

Activation for the segwit soft fork is being managed using
BIP9. At the beginning of the first retarget period after
segwit's start date of 1 January 2017 miners can update the Monacoin
client to Monacoin Core 0.13.2 to signal for segwit support. When a
super-majority of 75% is reached segwit is activated by optional, and
if 75% of blocks within a 8,064-block retarget period (about 3.5 days)
signal support for segwit, after another 8,064 blocks, segwit will
be required.

[segwit wallet developers guide][] or BIPs [141][BIP141], [143][BIP143],
[144][BIP144], and [145][BIP145].

Null dummy soft fork
-------------------

Combined with the segwit soft fork is an additional change that turns a
long-existing network relay policy into a consensus rule. The
`OP_CHECKMULTISIG` and `OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY` opcodes consume an extra
stack element ("dummy element") after signature validation. The dummy
element is not inspected in any manner, and could be replaced by any
value without invalidating the script.

Because any value can be used for this dummy element, it's possible for
a third-party to insert data into other people's transactions, changing
the transaction's txid (called transaction malleability) and possibly
causing other problems.

Since Monacoin Core 0.10.0, nodes have defaulted to only relaying and
mining transactions whose dummy element was a null value (0x00, also
called OP_0).  The null dummy soft fork turns this relay rule into a
consensus rule both for non-segwit transactions and segwit transactions,
so that this method of mutating transactions is permanently eliminated
from the network.

Signaling for the null dummy soft fork is done by signaling support
for segwit, and the null dummy soft fork will activate at the same time
as segwit.

For more information, please see [BIP147][].

[BIP147]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0147.mediawiki

Low-level RPC changes
---------------------

- `importprunedfunds` only accepts two required arguments. Some versions accept
  an optional third arg, which was always ignored. Make sure to never pass more
  than two arguments.


Linux ARM builds
----------------

Pre-built Linux ARM binaries have been added to the set of uploaded executables. 
Additional detail on the ARM architecture targeted by each is provided below.

The following extra files can be found in the download directory or torrent:

- `monacoin-${VERSION}-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz`: Linux binaries targeting
  the 32-bit ARMv7-A architecture.
- `monacoin-${VERSION}-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz`: Linux binaries targeting
  the 64-bit ARMv8-A architecture.

ARM builds are still experimental. If you have problems on a certain device or
Linux distribution combination please report them on the bug tracker, it may be
possible to resolve them. Note that the device you use must be (backward)
compatible with the architecture targeted by the binary that you use.
For example, a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B or Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (in its 32-bit
execution state) device, can run the 32-bit ARMv7-A targeted binary. However,
no model of Raspberry Pi 1 device can run either binary because they are all
ARMv6 architecture devices that are not compatible with ARMv7-A or ARMv8-A.

Note that Android is not considered ARM Linux in this context. The executables
are not expected to work out of the box on Android.


Change to wallet handling of mempool rejection
-----------------------------------------------

When a newly created transaction failed to enter the mempool due to
the limits on chains of unconfirmed transactions the sending RPC
calls would return an error.  The transaction would still be queued
in the wallet and, once some of the parent transactions were
confirmed, broadcast after the software was restarted.

This behavior has been changed to return success and to reattempt
mempool insertion at the same time transaction rebroadcast is
attempted, avoiding a need for a restart.

Transactions in the wallet which cannot be accepted into the mempool
can be abandoned with the previously existing abandontransaction RPC
(or in the GUI via a context menu on the transaction).
